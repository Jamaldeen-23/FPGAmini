#  Setup & Installation



***


### **Navigate to the Specific Project**

Each project has its own directory. Navigate to the project you want to work on:

Example:

    
    cd VsdSquadron_mini_fpga_uart_loopback

To view available files:

    
    ls
    

***


### **Clean Previous Builds**

Before starting a new build, clean old files using:

```sh
   sudo make clean
```

This removes any previous bitstream files.

***


### **Build the FPGA Bitstream**

To **synthesize the design and generate the bitstream**, run:

    sudo make build

This will execute:

- **Synthesis (Yosys)**
- **Place & Route (NextPNR)**
- **Bitstream Generation (IceStorm)**

***


### **Flash the FPGA**

Once the bitstream is built, upload it to the FPGA using:

```sh
    sudo make flash
```
This command programs the **VSD Squadron Mini FPGA board**.
