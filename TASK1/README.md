Verilog Code for RGB LED Control with Internal Oscillator
Introduction
This document provides a detailed explanation of a Verilog module designed to control RGB LEDs using an internal oscillator. The module utilizes a frequency counter to manage the timing of the LED signals, allowing for dynamic control of the LED colors based on the oscillator's output.

Key Concepts
The code consists of several key components:

Module Declaration: The top module defines the inputs and outputs, including the RGB LED outputs and a hardware clock input.
Internal Oscillator: An internal oscillator is instantiated to generate a clock signal for the frequency counter.
Frequency Counter: A counter that increments on each positive edge of the internal oscillator, which is used to control the timing of the LED signals.
RGB Driver: A driver that controls the RGB LEDs based on the PWM signals generated from the frequency counter.
Code Structure
The code is structured into several sections:

Module Declaration: Defines the module and its ports.
Internal Oscillator: Instantiates the oscillator to provide a clock signal.
Frequency Counter: Implements a counter that increments with each clock cycle.
RGB Driver Instantiation: Connects the RGB driver to the LED outputs.
