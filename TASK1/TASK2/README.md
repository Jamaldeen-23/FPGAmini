Introduction
This document provides a detailed explanation of a Verilog code that implements a UART transmission module alongside a simple RGB LED control system. The code is structured to facilitate the transmission of data via UART while simultaneously controlling RGB LEDs based on the received data.

Key Concepts
UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter): A hardware communication protocol used for asynchronous serial communication. The code implements an 8N1 UART transmission, which means 8 data bits, no parity bit, and 1 stop bit.
RGB LED Control: The code utilizes an RGB driver to control the color output of the LEDs based on the UART input.
Clock Management: The internal oscillator generates a clock signal that drives the UART transmission and LED control logic.
Code Structure
The code is divided into two main modules:

Top Module: This module integrates the internal oscillator, RGB LED driver, and UART transmission.
UART Transmission Module: This module handles the logic for sending data over UART.
Top Module
Inputs:
uartrx: UART receive pin.
hw_clk: Hardware clock input.
Outputs:
led_red, led_blue, led_green: Outputs for RGB LEDs.
uarttx: UART transmit pin.
UART Transmission Module
Inputs:
clk: Clock signal.
txbyte: Data byte to be transmitted.
senddata: Trigger signal to start transmission.
Outputs:
txdone: Signal indicating transmission completion.
tx: Transmit wire.
